1.Explain what Laravel's query builder is and how it provides a simple and elegant way to interact with databases.

Ans: Laravel's query builder is a fluent interface that allows developers to build and execute database queries using a simple and elegant syntax. It provides a convenient way to interact with databases without having to write raw SQL queries. The query builder allows you to perform various database operations such as selecting, inserting, updating, and deleting records. It supports a wide range of database systems and provides methods for building complex queries with ease.
 


2.Write the code to retrieve the "excerpt" and "description" columns from the "posts" table using Laravel's query builder. Store the result in the $posts variable. Print the $posts variable.

Ans: Code to retrieve the "excerpt" and "description" columns from the "posts" table using Laravel's query builder and print the result:

$posts = DB::table('posts')->select('excerpt', 'description')->get();
print_r($posts);


3.Describe the purpose of the distinct() method in Laravel's query builder. How is it used in conjunction with the select() method?

Ans: The distinct() method in Laravel's query builder is used to retrieve unique records from a table. It eliminates duplicate rows from the result set. It is used in conjunction with the select() method to specify the columns to be selected and to retrieve distinct values for those columns.



4.Write the code to retrieve the first record from the "posts" table where the "id" is 2 using Laravel's query builder. Store the result in the $posts variable. Print the "description" column of the $posts variable.

Ans: Code to retrieve the first record from the "posts" table where the "id" is 2 using Laravel's query builder, store the result in the $posts variable, and print the "description" column:
$posts = DB::table('posts')->where('id', 2)->first();
echo $posts->description;


5.Write the code to retrieve the "description" column from the "posts" table where the "id" is 2 using Laravel's query builder. Store the result in the $posts variable. Print the $posts variable.

Ans: Code to retrieve the "description" column from the "posts" table where the "id" is 2 using Laravel's query builder, store the result in the $posts variable, and print the $posts variable:

echo $posts;



6.Explain the difference between the first() and find() methods in Laravel's query builder. How are they used to retrieve single records?

Ans: The first() method is used to retrieve the first record that matches the query conditions, while the find() method is used to retrieve a record by its primary key. The first() method is typically used when you need the first matching record from a query result, while the find() method is used when you know the primary key value of the record you want to retrieve.


7.Write the code to retrieve the "title" column from the "posts" table using Laravel's query builder. Store the result in the $posts variable. Print the $posts variable.

Ans:Code to retrieve the "title" column from the "posts" table using Laravel's query builder, store the result in the $posts variable, and print the $posts variable:

$posts = DB::table('posts')->pluck('title');
print_r($posts);

8.Write the code to insert a new record into the "posts" table using Laravel's query builder. Set the "title" and "slug" columns to 'X', and the "excerpt" and "description" columns to 'excerpt' and 'description', respectively. Set the "is_published" column to true and the "min_to_read" column to 2. Print the result of the insert operation.

Ans: Code to insert a new record into the "posts" table using Laravel's query builder and print the result:

$result = DB::table('posts')->insert([
    'title' => 'X',
    'slug' => 'X',
    'excerpt' => 'excerpt',
    'description' => 'description',
    'is_published' => true,
    'min_to_read' => 2,
]);

echo $result ? 'Record inserted successfully.' : 'Failed to insert record.';


9.Write the code to update the "excerpt" and "description" columns of the record with the "id" of 2 in the "posts" table using Laravel's query builder. Set the new values to 'Laravel 10'. Print the number of affected rows.

Ans: Code to update the "excerpt" and "description" columns of the record with the "id" of 2 in the "posts" table using Laravel's query builder, set the new values to 'Laravel 10', and print the number of affected rows:
$affectedRows = DB::table('posts')
    ->where('id', 2)
    ->update([
        'excerpt' => 'Laravel 10',
        'description' => 'Laravel 10',
    ]);

echo 'Number of affected rows: ' . $affectedRows;


10.Write the code to delete the record with the "id" of 3 from the "posts" table using Laravel's query builder. Print the number of affected rows.

Ans:Code to delete the record with the "id" of 3 from the "posts" table using Laravel's query builder and print the number of affected rows:

 $affectedRows = DB::table('posts')->where('id', 3)->delete();
echo 'Number of affected rows: ' . $affectedRows;


11.Explain the purpose and usage of the aggregate methods count(), sum(), avg(), max(), and min() in Laravel's query builder. Provide an example of each.

Ans: The aggregate methods in Laravel's query builder allow you to perform calculations on a set of rows. Here are examples of each:

count(): Returns the number of records in a table.

 $count = DB::table('posts')->count();
echo 'Number of posts: ' . $count;

sum(): Returns the sum of values in a specific column.

$total = DB::table('sales')->sum('amount');
echo 'Total sales amount: ' . $total;

avg(): Returns the average value of a specific column.

$average = DB::table('products')->avg('price');
echo 'Average product price: ' . $average;

max(): Returns the maximum value in a specific column.

$max = DB::table('employees')->max('age');
echo 'Maximum employee age: ' . $max;

min(): Returns the minimum value in a specific column.

$min = DB::table('products')->min('price');
echo 'Minimum product price: ' . $min;


12.Describe how the whereNot() method is used in Laravel's query builder. Provide an example of its usage.

Ans: The whereNot() method in Laravel's query builder is used to add a "NOT" condition to a query. It excludes the records that match the specified condition. Here's an example:

$posts = DB::table('posts')
    ->whereNot('status', 'published')
    ->get();

print_r($posts);

In this example, the query retrieves all posts that do not have the status set to 'published'.


13.Explain the difference between the exists() and doesntExist() methods in Laravel's query builder. How are they used to check the existence of records?

Ans: The exists() and doesntExist() methods in Laravel's query builder are used to check the existence of records based on a query. The exists() method returns true if any record matches the query, while the doesntExist() method returns true if no record matches the query. Here's an example of their usage:

 $exists = DB::table('posts')->where('status', 'published')->exists();

if ($exists) {
    echo 'There are published posts.';
} else {
    echo 'There are no published posts.';
}



14.Write the code to retrieve records from the "posts" table where the "min_to_read" column is between 1 and 5 using Laravel's query builder. Store the result in the $posts variable. Print the $posts variable.
Ans: Code to retrieve records from the "posts" table where the "min_to_read" column is between 1 and 5 using Laravel's query builder, store the result in the $posts variable, and print the $posts variable:

$posts = DB::table('posts')
    ->whereBetween('min_to_read', [1, 5])
    ->get();

print_r($posts);


15.Write the code to increment the "min_to_read" column value of the record with the "id" of 3 in the "posts" table by 1 using Laravel's query builder. Print the number of affected rows.

Ans: Code to increment the "min_to_read" column value of the record with the "id" of 3 in the "posts" table by 1 using Laravel's query builder and print the number of affected rows:

$affectedRows = DB::table('posts')
    ->where('id', 3)
    ->increment('min_to_read');

echo 'Number of affected rows: ' . $affectedRows;
